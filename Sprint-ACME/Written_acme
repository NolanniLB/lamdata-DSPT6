- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

# I think it is important to look at the organization and structure of the code. If it is in the wrong order or confusing 
# order then it may not run properly. Another reason is that you don't want someone to be confused or not understand your
# code if they are supposed to check or help you with it so having it in a way others can understand is useful. Of course
# having it organized so the code can run smoothly is the goal in order to do your work efficiently as to not use all of your
# time having to go back and fix it. That could end up using most of your day which isn't helpful when you have a bunch to do.

- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

# Containers help us to be able to find what we need quickly so we can be efficient and keep to deadlines. When we use containers
# it helps put one subject or type of code together so we don't lose a piece. I like to think of containers kind of like a 
# filing system. It makes the most sense to put the related items together so it's all in one place. When your material is all
# in one place it can help to find what you are looking for if you know what area to start looking. If you make the starting 
# circumference smaller, then finding the material will take less time which means you can get more work done.
